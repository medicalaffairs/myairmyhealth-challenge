== Welcome to Philips' My Air My Health submission

The "My Air, My Health Challenge" is a multidisciplinary call from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Environmental Pollution Agency to innovators and software developers to enable near-real-time, location-specific monitoring and reporting of air pollutants and potentially related physiological parameters, using a personal/portable integrated system to assess connections between the two. The system should link air-pollutant concentrations with physiological data, provide geocoded and time-stamped files in an easy-to-use format, and transmit this data via existing networks to a central data repository.
